        <P>
          At MeUndies, I helped build out new features and redesign existing ones.
          Some of the pages and features I played a major role in:
          <br />
          - Desktop navigation
          <br />
          - Checkout
          <br />
          - The gift card flow
          <br />
          - Account Management
          <br />
          <br />
          In addition, I helped build our component library, and many of the shared
          components and icons used on the site.

        <H3>Disney</H3>
        <P>
          At Disney, I worked on www.shopdisney.com, which consisted of two main
          projects: the catalog, and checkout.
          {' '}
          <br />
          {' '}
          <br />

          The catalog portion consisted of an es5 backbone application, that was
          managed with a propetary CMS.
          <br />
          <br />

          Checkout (and the account portion) were built using create-react-app,
          was a separate, PCI compliant single page application.

          a node based API.
