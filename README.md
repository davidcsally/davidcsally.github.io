# Welcome to my website


This was built using:
- Create React App
- Styled Components (TODO investigate linaria)
- Typescript

That's about it!

Deployment:
- Github pages
- Netlify deploy previews

## Pipeline
- Pull requests run a test build script and previews are automatically deployed to netflify
- Merges into `main` automatically build and deploy to `master`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
haha just kidding, there's no tests.

### `yarn run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
